# Friends List
This is an app built with react to help keep track of your friends. Simple to use not beating around the bush.
There is an easy to use NavBar that takes you to the Home page where you can then navigate to add friends. After clicking
the Add Friends button you will be directed to a form where you will be asked to fill out personal information. Submit 
the form and you will be sent to your friends list where you will be able to see all your added friends information.
I will be adding a feature that will allow you to generate random friends and choose to add them or not, kind of like
a friend finder.
